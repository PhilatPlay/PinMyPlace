**GPS Location Sharing for Easy Deliveries**

## Concept

Help people in the Philippines (and beyond) share their exact location for deliveries using QR codes and shareable links.

## Problem Solved

- No formal addresses in many areas
- Delivery riders getting lost
- Time wasted giving directions over phone
- Inaccurate Google Maps pins

## Solution

1. User pins their exact GPS location
2. Generate QR code + short link
3. Share with delivery services
4. Riders scan/click → exact location opens in maps

## Monetization

- **Free**: 1 location, 30-day expiration
- **Premium (₱29/month)**: Unlimited pins, custom QR, delivery notes, permanent

## Tech Stack (Initial)

- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Maps: Leaflet.js / Google Maps API
- QR: QRCode.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express (future)
- Database: MongoDB (future)

## Next Steps

1. Clean up UI for location sharing focus
2. Add QR code generation
3. Add short URL service
4. Create payment integration
5. Build user accounts

## Target Users

- Online sellers (Shopee/Lazada)
- Remote workers ordering delivery
- People in subdivisions
- Provincial areas without street names
